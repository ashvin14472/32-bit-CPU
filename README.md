# Computer-Organization-and-Architecture
This repository consists of the entire engineering  of a 32-bit RISC Computer Programming Unit (CPU) using an FPGA through VHDL. The components are incrementally developed as follows: program counter, register set, ALU, data memory design and implementation, CPU datapath and simulation, CPU control unit, and the overall CPU schematic.

The device that was used to develop the schematics are on the Cyclone IV E: EP4CE115F29C7.
